**Moltbot** (formerly **Clawdbot**) is an open-source, highly extensible **Personal AI Agent** framework. Its core mission is to break the limitations of AI being confined to web-based chat boxes, transforming it into a "personal butler" deeply integrated with the user's local system and daily communication software.

It does more than just understand your intent; it completes tasks for you by executing code, operating browsers, and accessing local files. Moltbot emphasizes **local control**, **cross-platform accessibility**, and **proactive service**, giving AI genuine "hands" and "long-term memory."

### Core Highlights

* **Omni-Channel Accessibility**
Communicate with your AI via **Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Slack**, or even **iMessage**. Wherever you are, as long as you can send a message, you can control your home computer or server.
* **Powerful Tool Execution (Agentic Skills)**
Equipped with a built-in **Skills** system, the AI can directly execute shell commands, read/write local files, or use a headless browser (Puppeteer) to browse websites, scrape data, or fill out forms just like a human.
* **Local-First & Privacy**
All configurations, long-term/short-term memories, and sensitive data are stored on your local device. You can freely connect to cloud models like OpenAI and Claude, or integrate with **Ollama** or **LM Studio** for a completely offline AI experience.
* **Proactivity & Automation**
Unlike traditional "Q&A" bots, Moltbot is proactive. It can send you reminders, report results from automated scripts, or handle background tasks based on set triggers or scheduled intervals.
* **Highly Extensible Ecosystem (Skill Hub)**
Featuring a plugin-store-like ecosystem (**MoltHub**), users can easily install pre-built skills—such as calendar management, GitHub monitoring, or smart home control—or quickly develop their own custom skills using TypeScript.
